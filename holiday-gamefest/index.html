<h2>Gaming</h2>

<p>It’s all about the gaming, isn’t it? We’ll have access to the store library of Oakland’s It’s Your Move. You can bring your own games as well, but even if you don’t there is going to be plenty on hand! It will be largely open gaming with the possibility of some demos.</p>

<h2>White Elephant Gift Exchange</h2>

<p>Bring a silly gift and join us at 7pm for an optional white elephant gift exchange!</p>

<p>How it works: Put a wrapped gift in the pile and take a number. When your number comes up, you get to choose a gift from the pile, or steal one from someone else! Gifting games are alway a hoot.</p>

<h2>About Us</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This group grew out of some ideas bounced around by the KublaCon-attending contingent of “Legendary EastBay Gamers” (aka LEG) an informal game group that meets mainly in Oakland, California—now known by the PlayWest name. We wanted to create unique gaming opportunities for a wide cross-section of gamers in Northern California and beyond. We do both public and private events at various scales, including the Sierra PlayFest retreat.</p>

<p>Amber Davila and Eric Davila are the primary hosts and contact, aided by number of wonderful volunteers and contributors, without whom these events would not be possible!</p>
