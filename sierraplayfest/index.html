<h2>Lake Tahoe</h2>

<p>[location image]</p>

<p>Sierra PlayFest takes place on the picturesque and relaxing north shores of Lake Tahoe. Recreational opportunities abound both on the water and in the mountains. Everyone’s encouraged to get out and enjoy the scenery as much as the scene.</p>

<h2>About us</h2>

<p>This event grew out of some ideas bounced around by the KublaCon-attending contingent of “Legendary EastBay Gamers” (aka LEG) an informal game group that meets mainly in Oakland, California—now known by the PlayWest name. We wanted to create unique gaming opportunities for a wide cross-section of gamers in Northern California and beyond. We do both public and private events at various&nbsp;scales, including the first Sierra PlayFest, just last year. This year, we’re looking forward to welcoming you to our fun-loving group for an extended weekend of play.</p>
