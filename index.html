You can bring your own games as well, but even if you don’t there is going to be plenty on hand!</p>

	<img src="img/location.png" alt="map location" width="60%">
</p>

<p>Sierra playfest takes place on the border of the picturesque and relaxing north and west shores of Lake Tahoe. We’ll be gaming in a huge cabin with excellent views in a great environment, and there you’ll have the opportunity to enjoy the area, scenery, and outdoors in addition to gaming!</p>

<p>We’re actively working on some possibilities for organized, optional excursions in the Tahoe area. We’ll reach out to attendees about these as the event approaches!</p>

<h2>About us</h2>

<p>This event grew out of some ideas bounced around by the KublaCon-attending contingent of “Legendary EastBay Gamers” (aka LEG) an informal game group that meets mainly in Oakland, California. We wanted to create a unique gaming opportunity for a wider cross-section of gamers in Northern California and beyond. We’re looking forward to welcoming new gamers to our fun-loving group for an extended weekend of play.</p>

</p>
<p>Sierra PlayFest 2017 is a private, noncommercial event put on by volunteer organizers who are also paid attendees. In the unlikely event that something goes wrong, we will have event insurance as is generally required for parties, meetings, and other group events. We want this to be a welcoming, inclusive event and that is reflected in the event's <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1064drh-iP0oWUIJtftzNyxSMhkkKDVt8M3aTtjJ6yDw/edit?usp=sharing">Code of Conduct</a>.</p>
<p>We hope you'll join us for our first PlayFest event. We're already looking forward to 2018 and beyond, and your experiences and feedback this November will really help shape the future of PlayFest.</p>
