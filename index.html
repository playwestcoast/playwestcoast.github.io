<h2>Gaming</h2>

<p>[ friendly description of open gaming, main types of games played, plus details on how we will collaborate to plan brings/library/love to plays]</p>

<h2>About us</h2>

<p>This event grew out of some ideas bounced around by the KublaCon-attending contingent of “Legendary EastBay Gamers” (aka LEG) an informal game group that meets mainly in Oakland, California. We wanted to create a unique gaming opportunity for a wider cross-section of gamers in Northern California and beyond.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We hope you'll join us for our first PlayFest event. We're already looking forward to 2018 and beyond and experiences and feedback this November will really help shape the future of this endeavour.</p>
